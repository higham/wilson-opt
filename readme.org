* Optimizing the Wilson matrix

* About

==wilson_optimize== is a MATLAB function that computes the 
4-by-4 symmetric and symmetric positive definite matrices
with integer elements lying between 1 and 10 having the largest 2-norm
condition numbers.
The code takes about six hours to run on a PC with an
Intel Core i7-6800K processor.

* Requirements

The code was developed in MATLAB R2020b.
